1. Run npm install

2. The server and client file are separate and need to be started in a new terminal window.

3 . For the server file. Navigate into the server file. Run "npm start" and this will open a connection to the mongoDB hosted with
mlabs. I'm leaving my DB connection string in for now but you may need to change it in the future.

4. For the client file. Navigate into the client file. Run "npm start" this will start a react server on port 3000. You can now
go to http://localhost:3000 and see the client facing react app running.
